The adoption of smart contracts by central banks can have significant social and business impacts, as outlined below:

Social Impact:

1)Financial Inclusion: Central bank-issued digital currencies (CBDCs) through smart contracts can enhance financial inclusion. They provide access to digital payment and banking services to those who are unbanked or underbanked, potentially reducing economic disparities.

2)Reduced Transaction Costs: Smart contracts can enable low-cost and instantaneous cross-border payments, benefiting individuals and businesses by reducing the costs associated with international money transfers.

Business Impact:

1)Efficiency and Cost Savings: The use of smart contracts can streamline business operations within central banks. Automation can reduce operational costs, eliminate manual processes, and improve the efficiency of financial transactions.

2)Interbank Settlements: Smart contracts can facilitate interbank settlements and clearing, reducing the time and cost associated with these processes. This can benefit financial institutions and foster greater liquidity in the market
