Implementing smart contracts in a central bank requires careful consideration of various business requirements to ensure the success of the initiative. Here are key business requirements for central bank smart contracts:

Regulatory Compliance: Ensure that smart contracts comply with existing financial and regulatory frameworks. Central banks must work within the legal and regulatory boundaries of their jurisdiction.

Transparency: Smart contracts should be designed to provide transparency in all financial transactions and monetary policy decisions. This transparency helps build trust with the public and other stakeholders.

Security: Security is paramount when handling financial transactions and monetary policy. Smart contracts should employ robust encryption and security measures to protect sensitive data.

Scalability: Central banks handle a vast number of transactions, and smart contracts should be able to scale to accommodate increasing transaction volumes as the central bank's operations expand.

Privacy: While transparency is crucial, some data within the central bank's operations may need to be kept private. Smart contracts should offer privacy features to protect sensitive information.
